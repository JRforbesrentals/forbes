  <h2>2014 Samsung Smart TVs Aim For Easier Use<br>
  </h2>
  <p>The Hub Mag Published: 02 January 2014</p>
  <p><br>
    Samsung will showcase its 2014 Smart TVs with enhanced usability at Consumer Electronics Show (CES), held from 7th&ndash;10th January 2014 in Las Vegas.<br>
    Samsung&rsquo;s voice interaction service, which understands natural languages, has made the service more convenient by focusing on the most frequently used functions and taking into consideration user usage patterns.<br>
    Guy Kinnell, Head of TV and AV, Samsung UK, said: &quot;Samsung&rsquo;s 2014 Smart TV models deliver significantly improved voice interaction and motion control features so that our consumers will be able to enjoy our Smart TV more intuitively.  We will continue to develop content that integrates voice and motion recognition for added convenience.&quot;<br>
    Part of improvements made to the 2014 Smart TVs, users can change the channel in one step by saying the channel number and open a website or app using shortcuts.  For reference, 2013 models require two steps to change TV channels: &lsquo;Channel Change&rsquo; and &lsquo;Channel Number&rsquo;.  The voice search feature is also more convenient, letting users find all content results in one place.<br>
    When a consumer uses voice interaction to search for daily living information such as weather, stocks and sports, while watching TV, a pop-up window appears on the bottom of the page with search results.  Consumers can move to the app and see the details by clicking the pop-up.<br>
    Along with voice interaction, the motion control has been improved by adding the &lsquo;Finger Gesture&rsquo; feature, a significant improvement to motion control.<br>
    With &lsquo;Finger Gesture&rsquo;, users can change the TV channel, adjust the volume, find, and select what they want to watch just by using their fingers.  They can also go back to the previous screen and stop video playback by motioning their finger counter clockwise in a more intuitive way to control the TV.</p>
