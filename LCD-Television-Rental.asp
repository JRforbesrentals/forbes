    <h2>LCD Technology</h2>
    <h3>How do LCD Televisions work?</h3>
    <p>LCD televisions produce a black and coloured image by selectively filtering a white light, which is provided by a series of cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) at the back of the screen. Millions of individual LCD shutters arranged in a grid, open and close to allow a measured amount of the white light through. Each shutter is paired with a coloured filter to remove all but the red, green or blue (RGB) portion of the light from the original white source. The individual colours blend together to produce a single spot of colour, a pixel. Changing the relative intensity of the light passing through the sub-pixels controls the shade of colour. <em><a href="LCD-Technology.asp">Click For More Info</a></em></p>
