<h2>Plasma Technology</h2>
<h3>How do Plasma Televisions work?</h3>
<p>The basic idea of a Plasma TV screen is to illuminate tiny coloured fluorescent lights to form an image. Each pixel is made up of three fluorescent lights, a red light, a green light and a blue light. The Plasma TV display varies the intensities of the different lights to produce a full range of colours. Each cell acts like a mini fluorescent tube, emitting ultraviolet light, which then strikes red, green and blue spots on the screen.</p>
<p>These spots glow to build a picture.  One of the main drivers in Plasma TV's renaissance is the latest version of 3D TV technology. Plasma HDTV sets deliver a superior 3D viewing experience, because of Plasma TVs' faster pixel response time, which leads to a reduction in 'crosstalk' (where ghost/double images are seen around objects on screen due to the image stream intended for one eye being contaminated by that from the other). Black and white speckles may form on LCD TV screens and are caused by the burn out of the individual pixels in screen. On the other hand, the phosphor pixels in Plasma TV screens can become too hot and burn out on static images (so don't keep your Plasma TV paused for too long!).
</p>
<p>The Plasma TV enjoys the benefit of providing the best image quality and contrast ratio. Plasma TV screens capture individual frames in a highly detailed manner.</p>
