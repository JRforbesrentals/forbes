    <h2>Why Rent a Washing Machine?</h2>
    
   	<p>Normally there is only one washing machine in the house so what happens when it goes wrong? If you own your washing machine you will have to wait for service and parts, which can be both expensive and with the risk in some cases of it taking weeks, causing needless worry and a bill at the end of it.  At Forbes Rentals our customers have the benefit of knowing that their washing machine rental includes service by our own fully qualified engineers. </p>
   	<p>Calls placed before 10am are offered same day service and if we are unable to repair it on the day we will arrange for a replacement washing machine to be delivered, ensuring you are not left without your essential household item. Our Customer Care Department have a team of knowledgeable and professional people at hand to help and give you friendly guidance and advice. </p>
   	<p>If your washing machine goes wrong you are only ever a phone call away for service or support. Remember Rent and Relax.	</p>
