<p><strong>Recommend a friend and write your own cheque for &pound;50.</strong></p>
<p>Forbes Rentals are pleased to offer you an opportunity to introduce a friend to us and write yourself a cheque for &pound;50. All you have to do is to write your name and address on the cheque. Once your friend has had the rental equipment installed and made their second payment, Forbes Rentals will send you payment for the &pound;50. Alternatively contact our Sales Team by phone to advise them of your friend's details and we will complete your details for you and contact your friend to start their application.  *This offer only applies to new customers to Forbes living at a different address to your own.  The recommendation must be received before your friend's rental application has commenced.  Your rental payments must be up to date throughout the recommendation process. Customers paying rental by Direct Debit, &pound;50 will be credited into this bank account.  For Giro or other, please supply account details.</p>
