<h2>YouView, Freeview and Freesat Technology</h2>
<p>The Digital TV Group publishes and maintains the UK technical specification for high-definition services on digital terrestrial television (Freeview) based on the new DVB-T2 standard. The specification is known as the D-book. Freeview HD is the first operational television service in the world using the DVB-T2 standard and is not compatible with DVB-T.  It can only be received using compatible reception equipment.  To enjoy the full YouView experience you need good digital television coverage and a recommended broadband speed of 3.0Mb/s.</p>
  Broadband connection opens up a whole world of great television, including 7 day catch up from BBC iPlayer, 4OD, ITV Player and Demand 5, as well as on demand programmes.  The broadband connection also enables you to search through thousands of shows and keeps your YouView box up to date.</p>
